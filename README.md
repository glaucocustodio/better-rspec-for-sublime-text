# RSpec Buddy

RSpec syntax highlighting, implementation/spec toggling command, snippets and support for config file.

A modified fork of https://github.com/fnando/better-rspec-for-sublime-text.

What is different?

- it reads a `.rspec-buddy` file so you can customize the path to ignore when looking for spec and implementation files
- it has less snippets (just the ones I use often)
- some handy little tweaks

## .rspec-buddy file

Suppose you have the following structure:

```
project/
  lib/
    whatever/
      file.rb
```
By invoking the `rspec_toggle` command, this plugin will look for the spec file at `project/spec/whatever/file_spec.rb`.

But you can create a `project/.rspec-buddy` file with the content `lib/whatever/` for instance, then, the plugin will look for the spec file at `project/spec/file_spec.rb` (ignoring `lib/whatever/`).

This file is optional, by default `lib/` will be ignored.

## Toggling between implementation/spec

The default binding is `super+.`.

```json
{
  "keys": ["super+."],
  "command": "rspec_toggle"
}
```

You can change it to whatever you by adding the following snippet to your Keybindings file.

```json
{
  "keys": ["ctrl+alt+down"],
  "command": "rspec_toggle"
}
```

## Syntax Detection

The best way of setting the syntax automatically is using the [ApplySyntax](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ApplySyntax) package. Just install it and you're done!
